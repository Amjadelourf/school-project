                        A hippopotamus is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. Known for its massive size, the hippopotamus spends much of its time in water to stay cool and protect its sensitive skin from the sun. It has unique skin with a red, oily secretion that acts as a natural sunscreen. Despite their seemingly
						 slow demeanor, hippos are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa due to their territorial
						 nature and powerful jaws. They have large canine teeth and are known for their aggressive behavior, especially when they perceive a threat. The two main species are the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) and the smaller pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis).
